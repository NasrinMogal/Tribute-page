    <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam
   15 October 1931-27 July 2015 was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the president of India from 2002 to 2007. 
 Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam studied physics and aerospace engineering. 
  He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He was known as the "Missile Man of India" for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. 
  He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998,
   India's second such test after the first test in 1974.</p>

        <p>
     After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam became a member of the Defence Research & Development Service and 
     joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as a scientist.
     During his early career, he was involved in the design of small hovercraft, and remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.
     Later, he joined the Indian National Committee for Space Research, working under renowned space scientist Vikram Sarabhai.
     He was interviewed and recruited into Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) by H. G. S. Murthy, the first director of the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station.

         <p>
            In 1969, Kalam transferred to ISRO where he became the project director of India's first satellite launch vehicle (SLV) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980.
             He had earlier started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.[22] In 1969, Kalam received the approval from the Government of India to expand the programme to include more engineers.
              In 1963-64, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, and Wallops Flight Facility.
              Since the late 1970s, Kalam was part of the effort to develop the SLV-3 and Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), both of which were successful.
        </p>
        <p>
            In May 1974, Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the representative of Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory, even though he was officially not part of the project.
             In the 1970s, Kalam directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles using the technology from the successful SLV programme. 
             Despite the disapproval of the union cabinet, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted funds for these aerospace projects under Kalam's directorship through her discretionary powers. 
             Kalam also played a major role in convincing the cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified projects. 
             His research and leadership brought him recognition in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kalam served as the chief scientific adviser to the prime minister and secretary of the DRDO from July 1992 to December 1999. 
            He played a key organisational, political and technical role in the Pokhran-II nuclear tests conducted in May 1998.
            Along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, he served as the chief project coordinator for the tests.
            Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country's best known nuclear scientist.
            However, the director of the site test, K. Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report.
            The claim was refuted and rejected by Kalam and Chidambaram.
            In 1998, Kalam worked with cardiologist Bhupathiraju Somaraju and developed a low cost coronary stent, named the "Kalam-Raju stent".
            In 2012, the duo designed a tablet computer named the "Kalam-Raju tablet" for usage by healthcare workers in rural areas.

      Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest of whom was a sister, Asim Zohra (d.1997), 
      followed by three elder brothers: Mohammed Lebbai (5 November 1916-7 March 2021),Mustafa Kalam (d.1999) and Kasim Mohammed (d.1995).
       He was close to his elder siblings and their extended families throughout his life, and would regularly send small sums of money to his older siblings, 
       though he himself remaining a lifelong bachelor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Kalam was noted for his integrity and his simple lifestyle.
     He was a teetotaler, and a vegetarian.Kalam enjoyed writing Tamil poetry, playing the veena (an Indian string instrument), and listening to Carnatic devotional music every day.
     He never owned a television, and was in the habit of rising at 6:30 or 7 a.m. and sleeping by 2 a.m.
      His personal possessions included a few books, a veena, clothing, a compact disc player and a laptop.
     He left no will, and his possessions went to his eldest brother after his death.

     On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance which was in power at the time, expressed its intention to nominate Kalam for the post of the President of India.
     His candidature was backed by the opposition parties including the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party.
     After the support for Kalam, incumbent president K. R. Narayanan chose not to seek a re-election.
     Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature:

    "I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a message.
     I was thinking what message I can give to the people of the country at this juncture."
    </p>
    <p>
        On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and senior cabinet members.
        He faced off against Lakshmi Sahgal, and the polling for the presidential election was held on 15 July 2002, in the Indian parliament and the state assemblies, with the media predicting a win for Kalam.
        The counting was held on 18 July, and Kalam won the elections after securing 922,884 electoral votes as against the 107,366 votes won by Sahgal.
        He was sworn in as the 11th president of India on 25 July 2002.
         He was the first scientist and the first bachelor to occupy the top chair at Rashtrapati Bhawan.
